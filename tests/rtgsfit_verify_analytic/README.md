## Description
rtgsfit_verify_analytic sets up and runs analytic verification tests for RTGSFIT. Input data based on a known analytic solution to the Grad-Shafranov equation for large aspect-ratio Tokamaks. Runs RTGSFIT and checks that the numerical solution converges to the analytic as the number of iterations increases.

## Installation

```
uv venv --python 3.13
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

## Running Modules

To run a module such as `generate_constants_c` as a script, use Pythonâ€™s `-m` flag:

```bash
python -m rtgsfit_verify_analytic.generate_constants_c
```

This works from **any directory** as long as the package has been installed in editable mode (e.g. via `uv pip install -e .`).
